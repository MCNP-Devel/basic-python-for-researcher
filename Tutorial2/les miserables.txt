Preface from Les Miserables

So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom,
a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilisation,
artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a
destiny that is divine, with human fatality; so long as the
three problems of the age - the degradation of man by poverty,
the ruin of woman by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood
by physical and spiritual night - are not solved; so long as,
in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other
words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as
ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot
be useless.
