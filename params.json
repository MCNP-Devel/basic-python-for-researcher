{"name":"Basic Python For Researchers","tagline":"This repository contains ipython notebook tutorial on python programming language that I presented to my colleague in the workplace","body":"---\r\nThis tutorial is written as an introductory course to [_Python_](https://www.python.org/) programming language for my colleagues at [Malaysian Nuclear Agency](http://www.nuclearmalaysia.gov.my). It uses [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) as a teaching tools. It briefly covers almost all the necessary topics that will be helpful to them. The _IPython Notebook_ is an interactive computational system that run on a browser. It enables the users to document not only _Python_ but also other codes ([_Perl_](https://www.perl.org/) ,[_R_](http://www.r-project.org/) ,[_Julia_](http://julialang.org/), [_Haskell_](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) _etc._), written account, [_LaTeX_](http://www.latex-project.org/) equations, _HTML_, images and video. The document contains full record of all the computations and results. The document can be easily shared on email, [GitHub](http://github.com) or [nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org). This can fastly distribute the research works undertaken at the agency to other researchers. This effort to introduce _Python_ especially using the _IPython Notebook_ is narrated in an article (in [Malay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language)).  \r\n---\r\n###THE TUTORIALS  \r\n---\r\nThe tutorials are works in progress. Only the completed tutorials are listed here:\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n[**_Megat Harun Al Rashid bin Megat Ahmad_**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Megat_Harun_Megat_Ahmad)  \r\nlast updated: October 23, 2014.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
